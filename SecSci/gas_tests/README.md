# Gas Tests Experiment

An interactive virtual laboratory experiment for learning how to test for the presence of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapour using different chemical tests.

## Overview

This experiment demonstrates several common gas tests used in chemistry:

### Oxygen Tests
- **Glowing Splint Test**: A glowing splint relights in the presence of oxygen
- **Burning Splint Test**: A burning splint burns more brightly in pure oxygen

### Carbon Dioxide Tests
- **Lime Water Test**: Carbon dioxide turns clear lime water (calcium hydroxide) milky white
- **Hydrogencarbonate Indicator Test**: CO₂ dissolves to form carbonic acid, changing the indicator from red to yellow

### Water Vapour Test
- **Cobalt Chloride Paper Test**: Dry blue cobalt chloride paper turns pink in the presence of water vapour

## Features

- Interactive gas selection from multiple options
- Visual animations showing test procedures
- Real-time observation of test results
- Detailed explanations for each test
- Observation logging functionality
- Comparison of results across different gases

## How to Use

1. Select a gas from the dropdown menu (Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Water Vapour, Air, or Nitrogen)
2. Choose an appropriate test method for the selected gas
3. Observe the animated test procedure and results
4. Compare results with expected outcomes
5. Record observations in the log

## Educational Value

This experiment helps students understand:
- How to identify gases using chemical tests
- The principles behind each test method
- How different gases produce different test results
- The importance of control experiments
- Scientific observation and recording skills

## Technologies Used
